# Before you get Started

Lavender is currently on `Unity 2019.3.0f3`

We highly suggest using [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) in order to manage your unity installs.
Simply hit add, scroll to the bottom for beta & alpha versions, select the right one, then hit the checkmarks on
* Linux Mono
* Android

To create content for Lavender, first we need the Lavender SDK. If you’ve 
bought the game on Steam, the SDK can be found within the Steam Library of your
 account, search for “Lavender SDK”. Double clicking it will open the folder 
 containing a file named “LavenderSDK.unitypackage”, import this into Unity by 
 double clicking it while Unity is open, or by going to 
 `Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package` and browsing to the file.

Note: Make sure to backup your project if upgrading from an older version of 
Unity and make sure to remove other game SDKs from it as well to ensure 
compatibility. Project Defaults and Project Layers may fail to be setup in rare 
cases, to fix this, go to Lavender at the top of the Unity window and press 
`Setup Project defaults & Setup Layer defaults`
 For all content, we recommend having a proper folder setup for organization 
 purposes, a folder structure example such as “Assets/Avatars/modelname/model.fbx” 
 and a folder for materials, animations, scripts, sounds within each model 
 project is recommended.

## Updating Content

To update our content, we first have to go to [My Uploads](https://lavendervr.com/Content/MyUploads)
Here we’ll find everything we’ve uploaded, we can search through it, we can select the Content Type (All, Avatar, World, Prop, Gamemode) and we can order it by (Date Added, Name, Type).

Find the content you wish to update and hit Edit, this will bring up the page for it, browse to the updated Asset file and hit Upload. 
You may also change it to Private or Public and update the Description if required.
Once it’s done your content will be re-downloaded in-game on the next game restart
